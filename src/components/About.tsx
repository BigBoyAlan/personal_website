      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Driven by faith and a love for challenges, both on the rock and in code. I approach work and life with humility and a constant desire to learn and grow. My journey spans various fields, from developing complex technical systems to managing projects and fostering collaboration. I believe in building not just robust applications, but also strong relationships and empowering others through teaching and mentorship.
